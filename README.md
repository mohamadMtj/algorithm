# Request Management System with BST and MaxHeap

## 📌 Introduction
This project is a request management system that combines **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and **Max Heap** data structures to efficiently manage requests based on ID and priority.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Request management** with insert, search and delete operations
- **Automatic processing** of requests based on priority
- **Interactive CLI** with comprehensive menu
- **System status visualization**
- **Algorithmic optimizations** for high performance

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **Python 3**
- Data Structures: **BST**, **MaxHeap**
- Programming Paradigm: **Object-Oriented**

## 🚀 How to Run
1. First ensure you have Python 3 installed:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/request-management-system.git
   ```
3. Navigate to project directory:
   ```bash
   cd request-management-system
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📋 System Menu
The system provides an interactive menu with these options:
1. Insert new request
2. Delete request from BST
3. Search request in BST
4. Print BST (In-order)
5. Print BST (Pre-order)
6. Print MaxHeap
7. Process highest priority request
8. Increase request priority
9. Check if BST is empty
10. Check if Heap is empty
11. Get BST size
12. Get Heap size
13. Show system overview
14. Delete highest priority request
15. Exit
